- Anxiety and doubt undermine promotion motivation, leaving you less likely to take any action at all.

- I know this doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs, particularly if you are usually more the promotion-minded type,
but there is probably no better way to get over your anxiety about screwing up than to give some serious thought to all
the dire consequences of doing nothing at all.
"barrel of laughs" - source of immense pleasure

- Somewhere along the way, we've all bought into the idea - without consciously realizing it - that to be motivated and
effective we need to feel like we want to take action.
"buy into" - to start to do something that a lot of other people are doing

- Studies show that people routinely overestimate their capacity for self-control, and rely on it too often to keep them
out of hot water
"in hot water" - in a troublesome or difficult situation

- Do yourself a favour, and embrace the fact that your willpower is limited, and that it may not always be up to the challenge of
getting you to do things you find difficult and tedious or otherwise awful.
"be upto the challenge" - be able to act in response to a difficult situation

- One of these bestsellers is Wilson's Letters to a Young Scientist, which distills 60 years of teaching into a wonderful array of
unintuitive and surprising thoughts on creativity, innovation and scientific progress

- You never finish a book as quite the same person, and - much like how bacteria inject and transfer fragments of DNA to one another -
the best books transfer a part of the author's philosophy into your own head

- He likes to probe, to collect, to tinker
- He is not inclined to focus

- They find little reward in the necessarily tedious chores of data-gathering and analysis
- They choose not to take the hard roads to the frontier, over which the rest of us, the lesser intellectual toilers, must travel

- Some of them may have only an ephemeral interest and become a historical curiosity, while others last and become part of our active vocabulary

- Advertise our presence

- Interface with

- Anger simmers and seethes and threatens to interrupt

- An uncomfortable but powerful truth that took most of my 20's to internalize
- There's an opportunity cost to everything worthwhile in life

- When I was in college, there was a unianimously agreed upon definition of what success looked like.

- While it wasn't expicitly stated, it was implied through people's conversation, behaviours and decisions

- This is one of the most difficult things to give up because it is deeply embedded in our cultural narratives that it becomes the standard
by which we measure our lives

- Even as entrepreneurs we have collectively agreed that fame and fortune are the markers of success.

- Gambling on the uncertainity of my entrepreneurial path seemed like a better bet than the supposed guarantees that came with a steady paycheck.

- I figured building of body of work would be far more valuable than to keep adding to my resume of failures

- In the grand scheme of things, their judgement and approval was essentially meaningless

* In the grand scheme of things
- in the long term; in the complete picture of something
Eg - I know you are worried about getting a bad grade on this test, but you're such a great student that I doubt it will matter in the grand scheme of things.

- An ex or two that pullled the rug out from under us and our self-worth

* pull the rug out (from under someone)
- to make someone or someone's plans fall through; to upset someone's plans
Eg - Don pulled the rug out from under me in my deal with Bill Franklin

- We've lost people dear to us, keenly feeling the fragility of life

- By saying no to everything that's not aligned with your essential priorities, you make space for what it is.

- Just make sure, the juice is worth the squeeze

* juice is worth the squeeze
- make sure what you are doing and striving for is going to be worth the sacrifices you will have to make along the way
