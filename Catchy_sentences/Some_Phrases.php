- Anxiety and doubt undermine promotion motivation, leaving you less likely to take any action at all.

- I know this doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs, particularly if you are usually more the promotion-minded type,
but there is probably no better way to get over your anxiety about screwing up than to give some serious thought to all
the dire consequences of doing nothing at all.
"barrel of laughs" - source of immense pleasure

- Somewhere along the way, we've all bought into the idea - without consciously realizing it - that to be motivated and
effective we need to feel like we want to take action.
"buy into" - to start to do something that a lot of other people are doing

- Studies show that people routinely overestimate their capacity for self-control, and rely on it too often to keep them
out of hot water
"in hot water" - in a troublesome or difficult situation

- Do yourself a favour, and embrace the fact that your willpower is limited, and that it may not always be up to the challenge of
getting you to do things you find difficult and tedious or otherwise awful.
"be upto the challenge" - be able to act in response to a difficult situation

- One of these bestsellers is Wilson's Letters to a Young Scientist, which distills 60 years of teaching into a wonderful array of
unintuitive and surprising thoughts on creativity, innovation and scientific progress

- You never finish a book as quite the same person, and - much like how bacteria inject and transfer fragments of DNA to one another -
the best books transfer a part of the author's philosophy into your own head

- He likes to probe, to collect, to tinker
- He is not inclined to focus

- They find little reward in the necessarily tedious chores of data-gathering and analysis
- They choose not to take the hard roads to the frontier, over which the rest of us, the lesser intellectual toilers, must travel

- Some of them may have only an ephemeral interest and become a historical curiosity, while others last and become part of our active vocabulary

- Advertise our presence

- Interface with

- Anger simmers and seethes and threatens to interrupt

- An uncomfortable but powerful truth that took most of my 20's to internalize
- There's an opportunity cost to everything worthwhile in life

- When I was in college, there was a unianimously agreed upon definition of what success looked like.

- While it wasn't expicitly stated, it was implied through people's conversation, behaviours and decisions

- This is one of the most difficult things to give up because it is deeply embedded in our cultural narratives that it becomes the standard
by which we measure our lives

- Even as entrepreneurs we have collectively agreed that fame and fortune are the markers of success.

- Gambling on the uncertainity of my entrepreneurial path seemed like a better bet than the supposed guarantees that came with a steady paycheck.

- I figured building of body of work would be far more valuable than to keep adding to my resume of failures

- In the grand scheme of things, their judgement and approval was essentially meaningless

* In the grand scheme of things
- in the long term; in the complete picture of something
Eg - I know you are worried about getting a bad grade on this test, but you're such a great student that I doubt it will matter in the grand scheme of things.

- An ex or two that pullled the rug out from under us and our self-worth

* pull the rug out (from under someone)
- to make someone or someone's plans fall through; to upset someone's plans
Eg - Don pulled the rug out from under me in my deal with Bill Franklin

- We've lost people dear to us, keenly feeling the fragility of life

- By saying no to everything that's not aligned with your essential priorities, you make space for what it is.

- Just make sure, the juice is worth the squeeze

* juice is worth the squeeze
- make sure what you are doing and striving for is going to be worth the sacrifices you will have to make along the way


 - By "beginning with the end in mind", Rowling was able to direct and position the first book much differently

- People with high "self-efficacy" and internal locus of control radically outperform others

** Self-efficacy = your belief in your own ability to achieve your goals. Think “confidence.”

** Internal locus of control = a belief that you, not external circumstances, determine the outcomes of your life.

** External locus of control = a belief that factors outside of you determine the outcomes of your life.

- Humans are such funny critters.
** critters - a living creature/animal

- We were, not long back, roaming in the jungles, where no time-tables existed, no e-mails needed reply within the hour and no deadline could lead to the next acopalypse.

- We seem to live in a world where everybody is always certain and nobody is willing to concede that they might be wrong

- That said, more often than not, the issue lies in our inability to humbly accept that we don't know and can't know everything; that, often, we are wrong

- If we add in the complexity brought on as a result of our interactions with the world through the systems and ideologies we have in place, it's even more unlikely that we have complete knowledge

- In some ways, if we don't have a fully formed opinion, it makes sense to look toward the ideologies, groups, and people who we most generally identify with because there is already a proven track record of alignment

- It's better to not have an opinion than to naively pursue someone's else

- At any given point, there's only so much information we can make sense of. On a daily basis, there will be things we don't understand. If they aren't relevant, it's okay not to know. If they are, it's better to take time to think.

- This may seem fairly intuitive, and yet, the vast majority of people rarely find themselves comfortable enough to be at ease with not knowing. Instead, they recite from memory whatever has been ingrained into their mind.

- Our real selves are vastly more interesting that the pretend selves we adopt for others' consumption

- The real you may not be everybody's cup of tea, but then, that's why Baskin Robbin has 31 flavours of ice cream. Tastes vary.

- It doesn't matter what flavour you are, but it does matter that your flavour contains quality

- If we are ever to achieve some semblance of personal actualization, we need to stop being afraid.
** semblance - the outward appearance or apparent form of something, especially when the reality is different

- Embrace who you are and craft a winning combination around your quirks,idiosyncrasies and true self.

- To "allay" this existential dread, goverments and foundations did not address inequality or exploitation
** existential - relating to human existence

- Morning and evening routines prime you for success

- Many people forget that morning hours leading up to mid-day are enormously important - that these hours form the foundation of the entire day

- These statistics should prompt all rationalists to sound the proverbial tocsin with unrelenting fury
** proverbial - widely known or spoken of
** tocsin - alarm bell

- These words sound down through the years, a tocsin awakening us to that most grievous of failures - the loss of nerve

- A man who will, at best, be remembered as the impetus for a luminous grief memoir couldn't help but neg her.

- This was most excellent

- I have found myself overly critical of his work in the past, possibly due to the fact that he's so well known, but I feel it's more been a fault on my end

I wanted to share some of the things that really hit home with me

** hit home - to be fully understood by or strongly affect or resonate with someone

- Just like IT is, at heart, a disturbing coming-of-age story, The Shining was an impeccable tale of extreme cabin fever with a hefty dose of "the destructive nature of alcoholism".

** coming of age - the age or occasion when one formally becomes an adult.

- When you break it down like that, the supernatural elements actually seem to take a backseat to the very real horror of what it's like living with someone struggling through addiction

- I'm grateful my previous experiences with his wordier novels didn't deter me from finally choosing to read this, as it's a gem of a book and a classic in it's genre.

- Highly recommend to any other below-the-rock dwellers who may not have happened across this one

** below/under-the-rock - being oblivious or ignorant to what happens in the outside world

- Terrible events occur at an isolated hotel in the off season, when a small boy with psychic powers struggles to hold his own against the forces of evil that are driving his father insane

- At some point, you have to grow up and snap out of this false sense of reality

- It is also likely you aren't maximizing your potentail

- When time is thin and stakes are high, one of the most important skills to have as an entrepreneur is the ability to say no to things that don't align with your true properties
