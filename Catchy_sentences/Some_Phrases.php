- Anxiety and doubt underminde promotion motivation, leaving you less likely to take any action at all

- I know this doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs, particularly if you are usually more the promotion-minded type,
but there is probably no better way to get over your anxiety about screwing up than to give some serious thought to all
the dire consequences of doing nothing at all
"barrel of laughs" - source of immense pleasure

- Somewhere along the way, we've all bought into the idea - without consciously realizing it - that to be motivated and
effective we need to feel like we want to take action.
"buy into" - to start to do something that a lot of other people are doing

- Studies show that people routinely overestimate their capacity for self-control, and rely on it too often to keep them
out of hot water
"in hot water" - in a troublesome or difficult situation
