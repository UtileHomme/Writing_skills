- Anxiety and doubt undermine promotion motivation, leaving you less likely to take any action at all.

- I know this doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs, particularly if you are usually more the promotion-minded type,
but there is probably no better way to get over your anxiety about screwing up than to give some serious thought to all
the dire consequences of doing nothing at all.
"barrel of laughs" - source of immense pleasure

- Somewhere along the way, we've all bought into the idea - without consciously realizing it - that to be motivated and
effective we need to feel like we want to take action.
"buy into" - to start to do something that a lot of other people are doing

- Studies show that people routinely overestimate their capacity for self-control, and rely on it too often to keep them
out of hot water
"in hot water" - in a troublesome or difficult situation

- Do yourself a favour, and embrace the fact that your willpower is limited, and that it may not always be up to the challenge of
getting you to do things you find difficult and tedious or otherwise awful.
"be upto the challenge" - be able to act in response to a difficult situation

- One of these bestsellers is Wilson's Letters to a Young Scientist, which distills 60 years of teaching into a wonderful array of
unintuitive and surprising thoughts on creativity, innovation and scientific progress

- You never finish a book as quite the same person, and - much like how bacteria inject and transfer fragments of DNA to one another -
the best books transfer a part of the author's philosophy into your own head

- He likes to probe, to collect, to tinker
- He is not inclined to focus

- They find little reward in the necessarily tedious chores of data-gathering and analysis
- They choose not to take the hard roads to the frontier, over which the rest of us, the lesser intellectual toilers, must travel
