<!-- Adam Warlock vs The God Of Thun-dah! -->

This is the 2nd appearance of Adam Warlock (still Him, at this point) which takes place between his origin story in Fantastic Four #66 & his other origin story in Marvel Premiere #1.

Sadly, this is not the hot, muscular Hemsworth version of Thor. Oh no.
This?
This is the Thor that speaketh like thiseth, wears a great retarded helmet with wings, and looks as though his face has been repeatedly whacked with a shovel. <--sad face
Cheer up! Mayhap (Thor's word, not mine) he will look less ridiculous in the future.


Ok. So whatever happened in the last issue happened. And now he, Sif, and Balder are all the main attraction at some military parade (fun, fun!), after which Thor notices there are some strange energies emanating from inside a nearby building!

Who the...?! What the...?! Why the...?!
Well, well, well. It's nobody's favorite golden god, reemerging from his cocoon...again!
This will make the 3rd time I've seen this fucker smash his way out of that thing, and it gets less impressive each time, let me tell you.

Regardless, he gives a quick recap of his origin (minus the stuff about Alisha and the FF) that shows off his snazzy red panties and generic He-Man haircut.
He's so awesome he doesn't even have toes...

Then he gives this creepy speech where he announces that Sif's kinda cute and he needs a MATE. And then he takes off with her.
As you do.

Will Thorticus be able to rescue his lady love?
